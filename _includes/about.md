I love myself as much as I love candies. Yeah, I do love __candies__. And cats. And my dog. Also, _my dog loves cats too_.

Seriously, you should love me. You wont regret. I promisse.

My profile was created using [All About You](https://github.com/recarreira/all_about_you), an awesome __open source__ project created by my BFFs [Renata Carreira](http://renatacarreira.com) and [Roberto Soares](http://robertosoares.me).
Give it a try and create your own. It's free, easy, and you can free host it at [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/)! :D

_(Btw, I wrote that text. It will not appear on your about page. I mean, you <u>can</u> spread the word and share the project, but you <u>don't have to</u>.)_

My photo and background were designed by [Renata Carreira](http://renatacarreira.com). Yes, she has a very fertile mind.
